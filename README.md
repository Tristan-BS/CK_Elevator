## 🛠️ Configuration

All settings are in **`config.lua`**:

* `Config.KeyUp` & `Config.KeyDown` → Keybinds
* `Config.Buildings` → Add your buildings and floors
* `Config.UseESXNotify` → Toggle between ESX or RiP Notify
* `Config.CooldownMs` → Anti-spam cooldown

**Example:**

```lua
Config.Buildings = {
    {
        name = "Pillbox Hospital",
        floors = {
            { label = "EG", x = 287.70, y = -595.40, z = 43.16, h = 213.87 },
            { label = "1st Floor", x = 287.84, y = -595.27, z = 49.74, h = 311.65 },
            { label = "2nd Floor", x = 299.89, y = -598.25, z = 57.72, h = 299.91 },
